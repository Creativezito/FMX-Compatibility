> [!NOTE]
> - Remember to patch your Games if they need to be! Follow either tutorial in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki).
> - Before adding a Game to this list, **try removing any title updates**. Some Games may only work when title updates are deleted.
> - If a Game is listed as `‚ùå Borked` or `‚ö†Ô∏è Partial` in a specific format, try converting via another method. It might work completely!!
